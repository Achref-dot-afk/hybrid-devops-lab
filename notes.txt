-> Things to configure in AZ cloud before implementing the project :
- Create a resource group
- Create a Storage Account
- Get a Storage Account Key
- Create a Blob Container
- Assign the role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" to allow terraform to write/read the state blob object
- Register "Microsoft.Storage" Resource Provider because the requests to azure services go through these providers and
 if a provider isnâ€™t registered in your subscription, you cannot create or manage resources from the service.
